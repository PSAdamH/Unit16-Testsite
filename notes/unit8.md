+ instagram: Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social media application that was launched in 2010 by Kevin Systrom. The first prototype of Instagram was a web app called Burbn, which was inspired by Systrom's love of fine whiskeys and bourbons.

+ Discord: Since launching in 2015, Discord has quickly become one of the top places for video game players to gather and communicate online. it was originally just a game feature that the founders developed. The app emerged from a gaming studio run by Jason Citron and Stan Vishnevsky. The studio developed a tablet-based multiplayer game with an inbuilt voice function to help people communicate.

+ Snapchat: Snapchat was founded in 2011 by Evan Spiegel, Reggie Brown, and Bobby Murphy, all students at Stanford University. Reportedly, Brown came up with the idea of a social media app that enabled users to post photos and videos that disappeared from the site after a few moments.

+ Tiktok: TikTok was created by Chinese tech giant ByteDance and was first released in September 2016 under the name “Douyin”, which was marketed as a video-sharing social networking service similar to Facebook and Instagram(which are both banned in china).

+ Twitter: The origins of Twitter date back to early 2006, when NYU student Jack Dorsey shared a new online communication idea with some of his coworkers at Odeo, a podcasting company. Dorsey's idea was a platform that allowed users to share short messages with groups of people, similar to sending text messages.

+ Reddit: Reddit was founded way back in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, a couple of college roommates at the University of Virginia.
